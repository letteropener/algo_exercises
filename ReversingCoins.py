Consider n coins aligned in a row. Each coin is showing heads at the beginning
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Then, n people turn over corresponding coins as follows. Person i reverses coins with numbers
that are multiples of i. That is, person i flips coins i, 2i, 3i, . . . until no more appropriate
coins remain. The goal is to count the number of coins showing tails. In the above example,
the final configuration is:
[2,3,5,6,7,8,10]

Tails: 1,4,9

# O(n log n):
'''
The number of operation can be estimated by n/1 +n/2 +. . .+n/n, what equals 
nÂ·(1/1 + 1/2 +. . .+ 1/n).
The sums of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals) of the first n numbers are 
called harmonic numbers, which asymptotically equal O(log n). In summary, 
the total time complexity is O(n log n).
