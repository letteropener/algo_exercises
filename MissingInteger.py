'''
Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.

Given A = [âˆ’1, âˆ’3], the function should return 1.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

    if 0 in aux_list: return aux_list.index(0)+1
